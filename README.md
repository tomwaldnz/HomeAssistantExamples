# Home Assistant Examples
This repo provides examples of automations and related resources that I use for Home Assistant. Many of these will be for the Airtouch 4. I will eventually add some AppDaemon programs that do things such as provide a guess at the outdoor status of the ducted unit based on observed temperatures (which is useful to know for some automations) and a countdown timer to turn any entity off using a slider. I'll provide a dashboard or two at some point as well.

The automations work with home assistant `2024.6.1'. I have modified the automations very slightly to add them to this git repo, there may be minor errors from the copy / paste / edit process.

I use [this Airtouch custom component](https://github.com/mihailescu2m/hass-airtouch4-platform). If I was starting again now I would look into [this component](https://github.com/TheNoctambulist/hass-airtouch) which is more actively maintained - though the component I use works perfectly and hasn't needed changes for months or maybe even years. 

## Room / Area Controls
A useful feature I developed is what I call "Room Controls". This lets me simply enable or disable automations for a room or resource using simple toggles.

## Important Recommendation
It's strongly recommended you read all the README files in each folder that you use resources from. If you don't do that you'll probably have significant problems.

## Bugs / Help
If anyone asks for help I'll help the best I can when I have time available. Patience is likely required. I am likely to reply eventually even if it's just to say "I don't know".
