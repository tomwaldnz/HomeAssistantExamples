alias: ATP Guest Overnight Limit Damper Overheat Overcool 2200 - 0630
description: >-
  This automation simply stops the room damper opening past a certian percentage. When a single
  room is heating / cooling at night the Airtouch would completely open the damper and as a result
  the room would get very hot or cold. This was particularly noticable in smaller rooms.
  This automation reduces the maximum heating or cooling to the room.
