# Home Assistant Automations
These Airtouch 4 automations are based on the custom component [hass-airtouch4-platform](https://github.com/mihailescu2m/hass-airtouch4-platform).

In particular automations in this folder aim to minimise the amount of air going into the spill zone, preventing it overheating. Our living area / lounge is our spill zone and without these sorts of automations it would get to 3 or 4 degrees above set point. With these automations it rarely goes more than 1 degree above set point. You will need a similar automation for each room other than the spill zone.
